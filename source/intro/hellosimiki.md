# Hello #

Several days ago, I started a new trial on Google Cloud Platform.

It's very powerful and fantastic platform, So I have an idea, I want to deploy wiki site that easier to collect some own work and life stuff at any time. 

Although I have my own [technical blog](https://io.itabas.com) powered design by [Hexo](https://hexo.io), but I also like new and creative things. 

This's a tiny and light framework, you can do anything whatever you want.

Thanks [Tankywoo](tankywoo.com) again.
